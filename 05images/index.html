        <p>Self-help is actions a person can take themselves to imporve their own life. This can look like progressing on habits or even improving problems. Self-help can start with 
            goals. Everyone is different so naturally the goals for each individual will differ. Improving oneself is a <strong>life long commitment</strong>. It takes time and work to get better and that's okay
            because we each move at our own pace. 
        </p>
        <h1>Why Self-Help?</h1>
        <p>Self-help is vital to create our own reality. Our goals, aspirations, dream-self, all rely on us as individuals. We are in charge of our own decisions and what they will lead to. In this
             website we will learn what self-help looks like and how we can apply it to ourselves. There probably won't be a one-size-fits-all solution or tip. That is why we emphasize and embrace experimentation. There's 
             only way to find out if something works for us and to brave to try is the best part. It's important to learn about it but it's even more important to practice it. The goal is to improve and 
             the only way to get there is to start. I challenge to take one piece of information you learn that resonates with you and apply it simply in your life. See how one little change can effect your
              perspective on the ability to better your life.

        <h2>Working on Productivity</h2>
        <p>Productivity is outcome of planning and diligence. That's why we're going to break down productivity in two parts.</p>
        <h4>Planning</h4>
        <p>The first part is planning, and the second is about discipline.There's usually two ways in which people go about their day and do what they do. One way is through remembering and keeping track of the brain. This can look like creating a to-list in your head and following it by your best ability, remembering, sorting through priority, and efficiency. It's easy for people to forget important things or make decisions that further lessen efficiency in their day-to-day tasks.</p>
        <p>The other way to go about tasks is by planning. Planning starts with goals and those can be categorized as long-term and short-term. As soon as someone has their list of goals they can begin to split each goal into chunks for more manageable periods. For example, I have a long-term goal to drink more water. This can be broken down to a daily goal which I have set to drink 91 ounces of water every day. It’s important to note that the smaller goal, whether a daily task or overview every week, is to make it specific.</p>
        <p>Every day there will be things that need to get done and things that need to get started. The first step is to create a list of tasks for the day and consider how long each one will take. Then create a rough schedule that takes these tasks and fits them around your day in which order works best for you.</p>
        <h4>Discipline</h4>
        <p>Discipline is essential to create actions into habits. It is also necessary to complete tasks in an appropriate amount of time. Discipline is the act of doing something necessary without letting present emotions affect the goal.</p>
        <p>Many different problems come up that affect people from not being able to work on something habitual and for a long period. That’s why it's important to identify your struggle with discipline and find out what is preventing you from accomplishing what you want to.</p>
        <p><u>Struggles and Solutions</u></p>
        <p>Distractions. One thing I've learned is that I cannot work in an area that has a lot of commotion so I choose to change my environment based on what helps me stay focused. This applies to anyone since the environment will be specific to your needs. Whether that be somewhere where other people are working, a quiet area like a library, or a specific place in your home that is most inspiring.</p>
        <p>Burnt out. It’s very easy to get lost in work and find out you’ve been working for three hours straight. This range of time working can work for some people but generally, it leaves a lot of us exhausted to the point where there’s not enough energy to try again, even after a break. One method of scheduling work versus break time is the Pomodoro technique. This works by working on a task for a designated time and then having a break for a designated time then repeating this process. The time ratios depend on how long you work on a task. One example is working for 25 minutes and scheduling a break right afterward for five minutes. This can help your body stay focused and be able to rest and keep energy to move at a steady pace for a long time.</p>
